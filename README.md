Choose Your Own Adventure Game - A user-generated text adventure

Choose Your Own Adventure Game, or CYOAG for short, is an idea Steven Kitzes
came up with, based on the choose-your-own-adventure books he grew up with.
The basic idea behind these books was that the reader would be presented with
very short chapters for context; then get to pick from a handful of options
leading to different page numbers, ultimately resulting in different paths
through a story that always started the same but had many possible endings.
Steven enjoyed reading, and was thrilled to discover books with variable
outcomes.

Now, later in life, Steven has come to love writing as much as he loves reading.
Having grown into a career in software development, and remembering his love of
choose-your-own-adventure books, he decided it would be a great potential side
project to build a website that combines all of these loves into one.  The CYOAG
is, thus, a web app that proposes to let users read and/or create content for a
choose-your-own-adventure game online.
